        <p><strong>Panda Music Database Application</strong></p>
        <p class="description">
          The Panda Music Database Application is designed to manage vinyl
          records for a music library, utilizing SQL Server as the backend to
          handle data storage and querying. I created tables, set relationships,
          and applied constraints to ensure data integrity. With an intuitive
          user interface built in MS Access, the application provides accessible
          forms, reports, and queries for seamless data input and retrieval.
          Through this project, I gained practical experience in database design
          and application development.

        <p><strong>Airlineâ€™s Baggage Checking Program </strong></p>
        <p class="description">
          This Java-based program assesses the eligibility of customer baggage
          for carry-on, following airline policies. Developed with
          object-oriented principles like Inheritance, Encapsulation, and
          Polymorphism, the program ensures modular, reusable code that
          accurately reflects real-world baggage constraints. Through this
          project, I enhanced my Java programming and problem-solving skills by
          designing solutions for industry-specific challenges.

        <p class="description">
          Guess My Number game is a timed, interactive web game where players
          guess a hidden number between 1 and 20 within 30 seconds. With
          difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), it provides responsive
          feedback and score tracking. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          the game features an engaging UI with dynamic color changes and
          interactive messages, making each guess exciting as players race
          against the clock.
